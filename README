Lyra is a simple cli program to manage fortune files. It can read
directly from plain-text files, creating datafiles through `strfile' is
not required.

This also means that it has less features compared to fortune(6).
Default directory is assumed to be `$HOME/fortunes'.

This program is not useful if you have `strfile' installed, just use it
& place the datafiles in fortune directory.
